   <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>I didn't know what I wanted but I knew that if I stayed in my hometown I wouldn't find it. Reaching out, I was looking for keywords as much as a feeling. I found it in "Visual Communication Design" - 3 words I never would've put together but was exactly what I was looking for. I got here from running away, but the interesting part of the story has always been why I chose to stay.</p>
